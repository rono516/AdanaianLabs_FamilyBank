This is an e-commerce website developed during the months long training from Family Bank by Adlasian.
The Stack used for development was Laravel and JavaScript for other functionalities:
Some of the intergrated functionalities are :
#Role_based access to the website
#Both front-end and back-end functionalities developed using Laravel
#Display of product details and adding to cart
#Admin management of users and user groups access


Other functionalities I'm working on while continuing to improve my Laravel, PHP, and JavaScript is:

#Mailing
#Scheduling using Laravel
#AWS S3 storage from Laravel
